Things to fix/improve, or file a bug in launchpad:

- change transcoding pass to have an extra command_muted attribute containing the muted version of that transcoding pass
- upload form to have option to flag a video as "mute derivates"
- transcoder to recognise the attribute mute_export and use the mute versions of the transcoding passes
- add new video state: rejected
- fill up video created_date on the first uploader
- check if for hash colision after first uploading to avoid duplicates
- replace the hardcoded s3 foldername 'originals' with a setting variable
- replace the hardcoded s3 bucket 'camera' with a setting variable
- remove the hardcoded 'mts' references -> original videos might come with a different format
- modify the transcoder daemon to NOT download files from s3, a transcoder should be a transcoder, not a downloader/transcoder
- modify the transcoder daemon to NOT upload back to s3, a transcoder should be a transcoder, not a transcoder/uploader
