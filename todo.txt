------------ Old ---------
Things to fix/improve, or file a bug in launchpad:

- check for duplicates on upload
- change transcoding pass to have an extra command_muted attribute containing the muted version of that transcoding pass
- upload form to have option to flag a video as "mute derivates"
- transcoder to recognise the attribute mute_export and use the mute versions of the transcoding passes
- check if for hash colision after first uploading to avoid duplicates
- replace the hardcoded s3 foldername 'originals' with a setting variable
- replace the hardcoded s3 bucket 'camera' with a setting variable
- modify the transcoder daemon to NOT download files from s3, a transcoder should be a transcoder, not a downloader/transcoder
- modify the transcoder daemon to NOT upload back to s3, a transcoder should be a transcoder, not a transcoder/uploader

ok?- remove the hardcoded 'mts' references -> original videos might come with a different format
ok? - fill up video created_date on the first uploader
ok?- update convertion script to include width and height on video versions
ok - buy a linode (or other dedicated server) host
ok- migrate the wiki to somewhere
ok - run through all video versions and update to include width and height
ok - create new script to generate static JPG video versions
ok - add new video state: rejected
