There are 2 daemons under the bin directory:

 * One that checks the database for new Videos that still needs to be 
 uploaded to S3 and then do it. (s3_uploader)
 * One that checks the database for Videos on the queue waiting to be 
 transcoded and executes the necessary jobs to generate different
 Video Versions (transcoder.py)
 
 
 You will need to rename aws.conf.example to aws.conf and fill it with
