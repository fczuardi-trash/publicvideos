<h2>About Public Videos</h2>
<p>
  Public Videos is a repository of open, original, high-quality, and
  royalty-free video footage that are released or waiting-to-be-released
  into the commons as public domain with the help of the website users.
</p>
<p>
  The goal of this website is to jumpstart a “free as in freedom” 
  massive worldwide clips-farm to be used by anyone (free-culture artists, 
  bloggers, filmmakers, programmers, news media outlets, music bands,
  game developers, etc) for anything safely.
</p>
<p>
  Since December of 2008, hundreds of original generic clips and scenes 
  have been recorded using high definition cameras in different places 
  of the planet to be released to the commons in an effort sponsored by me.
  And soon others will also be able to contribute for the growth of 
  this collection by recording and donating their own clips or sponsoring
  the liberation of existing ones.
